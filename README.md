For this project the following animations have been applied:

* The :hover pseudo-class and transform property for the animation of the logo in the top left corner

* The :hover pseudo-class and various properties for the animation of the buttons in the navigation bar

* Keyframes for the loading animation



* Additional notes *

I haven't commented what I've done in the CSS, but hopefully it's apparent. I did however comment out each section for the site just so you have a better overview when scrolling through the code.

I had created another animation on the bottom of the site, but the position property kept messing up the layout and I couldn't figure out how to solve it, so I ended up deleting it, just so I would have a proper product to hand in.

To make the site responsive for tablet and mobile I used media queries.
